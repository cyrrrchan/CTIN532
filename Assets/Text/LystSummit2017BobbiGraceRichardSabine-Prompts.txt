Prompts
10th June 2017


That moment when I met my perpetrators
That moment when you told me you didn’t love me
That moment when my pet died
The last time I visited the graveyard
That moment I had suicidal thoughts
That moment I played in the band
That time I felt alone
The first time I realized what death was
The first time I thought about my own death
That time I was caught with my pants down
The time I felt like now I could speak a new language
The evening of my first school dance
My first time leaving home
My first period
My first time on my own in the city (if I grew up in the countryside)
My first time on my own in the countryside  (if I grew up in the city)
The time my parent had the sex talk with me
That time I was punched in the face
That time I punched someone
The first time I cried in public
The first time I understood difference
The first time I had a panic attack in public
The time my first pet arrived at my home
The time my first pet died
The time my first pet peed on me
The time I had a nightmare so terrifying that it woke me up
The last words they said to me before they left, the final time
The time I wanted to get into a fight
A time when my parents told me they were proud of me
The time I got a text message in the middle of the night that shocked me
The time I got a text message in the middle of the night that frightened me
The time I got a text message in the middle of the night that made me sad
The time I got a text message in the middle of the night that made me happy
A time someone caught me and didn’t let me go
The first time I snuck out of the house
The first time I saw a music video
The time we just looked into each other’s eyes instead of going to sleep
The first time I overhead a terrible argument
My first love
The time I found a dead animal
